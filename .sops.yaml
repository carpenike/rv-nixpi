  # config files for sops & used for encrypting keys that sops-nix decrypts.
  # each machine key is derieved from its generated `ssh_hosts_ed` file
  # via ssh-to-age
  # sops encrypts the secrets ready to decrypt with the private key of any of the below machines
  # OR my 'main' key thats kept outside this repo securely.
  
  # key-per-machine is a little more secure and a little more work than
  # copying one key to each machine
